# project-euler-marathon-python
Solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) programming marathon.

Also solving ProjectEuler+ at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges) in the same time (same problems with multiple test cases and stricter time limits and larger input size contraints)

# Notes
- Several problems contain multiple solutions based on different aproaches of varying complexity.
- The file Euler.py contains several frequently used helping function and it's being updated with newer functions.
