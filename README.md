# project-euler-marathon-python
Solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) programming marathon.

Also solving ProjectEuler+ at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges) in the same time (same problems with multiple test cases and stricter time limits and larger input size contraints)

# Note
Several problems contain multiple solutions based on speed (complexity) or simply different approaches if it's interesting to write. Also, every solution will be tested against the HackerRank online judge (1-216 at the moment exist there) before commiting it here.

# Note 2
I'm posting some of these solution to the private Project Euler forums liked with each problem
